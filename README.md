# Student_Result_Analysis

This project is a data analysis exercise aimed at understanding and analyzing student performance using Python's powerful data analysis libraries: NumPy and Pandas. The dataset, downloaded from Kaggle, contains records of student results, and the analysis focuses on extracting key insights, such as performance trends, outliers, and statistical metrics.

Key Features:
!) **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing or inconsistent data to ensure accurate analysis.
2) **Data Transformation**: Processed and transformed the data for better usability and readability.
3) **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed student performance data to identify trends and patterns.
4) **Statistical Insights**: Generated summary statistics to understand the distribution of scores and other relevant metrics.

This analysis was performed in a Jupyter Notebook, with visualizations and insights presented in a clear and organized manner.
